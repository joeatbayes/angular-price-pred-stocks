DONE:JOE:2022-09-05: Only use first X% of bars for initial analysis
  write a simple back tester looking for win% > 70%
  and net_P&L > 1%.  This also requires moving the stats
  computation out into a function producing a stats data 
  package so we can use it in the back trace. 

TODO: num_hold_days_bars is in 3 different parts of the code.  Need 
  to use a config settings module to avoid that duplication. 



TODO: I don't think the algorithm we are using for the BestNumDayFit::sim_score
   is quite right.  I think we need to instead measure the  sqrt of sum of the 
   sq root of the difference between the lines converted into average per line
   point. It still looks like the contribution from short slope is not right
   because it should be dominating the score sort and slopes furthest from
   short slope seem to dominate. 

TODO: Make it easier to skip very old bars for the training
   set.  Use something in config to allow skipping some bars in the 
   input data set.  EG: It may not be valuable to 
   include bars from 15 years ago when the trading regime
   was quite different to predict current price movements.

TODO:  Implement lower level unit tests so we can better isolate
   where problems exist.
